# Chadwick Baseball Bureau
## The baseball data scientists and historians

<img src="assets/chadwick.jpg" align="left" style="padding: 1em;"/>
**Chadwick Baseball Bureau** supports baseball professionals, analysts, and the broader
research community by curating current and historical baseball data sources, and
producing reproducible builds of datasets.
We create value for our clients and for the community by allowing users to focus 
on understanding and acting on data, by efficiently handling data collection and
integration at scale.

We provide data to a number of high-profile clients across the industry, including being 
a primary provider of historical statistical data for 
[Baseball Reference](http://www.baseball-reference.com)Â for major, minor, international, collegiate, and summer collegiate competitions.

### From curation to compilation

As historians we place a high value on curating and organising source information.
Further, in a digital world, statistics and other data can be ephemeral, especially as leagues and
platforms come and go.  As an independent organisation, we work with leagues and platforms to
improve the quality of their data, and to archive published information.
We are therefore able to focus on **looking after history as a whole**, linking across
countries, governing bodies, and levels of play, in the current season and across time.

To get a flavour for our approach, you can read about how we are
[building the comprehensive data resource on the history of the minor leagues](doc/historical).

### For the community

We provide a number of tools and resources on an Open Source/Open Data basis:

  * The [Chadwick](https://github.com/chadwickbureau/chadwick) tools for working
    with [Retrosheet](http://www.retrosheet.org) data.
  * A [repository](https://github.com/chadwickbureau/retrosheet) with a version of the data released by
    [Retrosheet](https://www.retrosheet.org), patched with known corrections.  For convenience, we also provide
    [splits and day-by-days](https://github.com/chadwickbureau/retrosplits) extracted from the Retrosheet corpus.
  * The [Chadwick persons register](https://github.com/chadwickbureau/register), which has nearly 500k entries
    for people who have played, managed, umpired, or otherwise been involved in baseball.  This includes personnel
    from North American-based professional leagues back to the 19th century,
    as well as personnel from leagues around the world and college baseball.
    The public version of the Register also facilitates linked data by reporting cross-references against several
    major ID systems; more detailed cross-references are available to our partners on a subscription basis.

### How can we help you?

We provide a range of data feeds, which we can
customise in terms of scope, frequency, and delivery format to suit your needs.
