# Writing baseball history in tidy datasets

<img src="assets/chadwick.jpg" align="left" style="padding: 1em;"/>
**Chadwick Baseball Bureau** supports baseball professionals, analysts, and the broader
research community by curating current and historical baseball data sources, and
producing reproducible builds of datasets in tidy, standard formats.
We create value for our clients and for the community by allowing users to focus 
on understanding and acting on information, rather than spending their time compiling
and integrating it.

We provide data to a number of high-profile clients across the industry, including being 
a primary provider of historical statistical data for 
[Baseball Reference](http://www.baseball-reference.com)Â 
for major, minor, international, collegiate, and summer collegiate competitions.


**For our professional clients**, we provide a range of data feeds, which we can
customise in terms of scope, frequency, and delivery format to suit your needs.

<!---

**To support the community** and encourage the development and use of common standards
for baseball information, we provide a number of
[datasets and tools released under Open Data and Open Source terms](http://chadwick-bureau.com/open-data/).
These include:

  * The [Chadwick](http://chadwick.sourceforge.net) tools for manipulating baseball play-by-play data, which are compatible with and extend the DiamondWare tools provided by [Retrosheet](http://www.retrosheet.org). The software is released under the GNU General Public License.
  * A [git repository](http://github.com/chadwickbureau/retrosheet) with a version of the data released by [Retrosheet](http://www.retrosheet.org), patched with known corrections.
  * A [cross-reference register](http://chadwick-bureau.com/the-register "The register") of all players, managers, and umpires known to have participated in professional baseball, as well as college players and others with off-field involvement in pro ball, with identifiers in many major ID systems.
