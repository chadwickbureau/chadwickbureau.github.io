title: Incorporating non-baseball biographical sources
---

The appearance of the *Macmillan Baseball Encyclopedia* in 1969 is perhaps the single most
significant milestone in the recording of baseball history.
For the first time, players' career statistics had been systematically re-tabulated by
going back to sources.

Statistics were naturally the focus of the bulk of the Big Mac.
However, the book also marked the first appearance of a truly systematic register of
people who had played in the Major Leagues, listing not only their year-by-year
career performance, but also information on their full names and dates and places of
birth and death.

The existence of this information, which forms the core of the biographical data on
baseball persons, owes much to [Lee Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Allen_(baseball)),
who was historian at the Hall of Fame in the 1960s.
Allen made it his business to know about players as people - what they got up to
outside of baseball, after their retirement, where they lived, and, when and where
they passed away.

## The Lee Allen group

Consulting non-baseball sources is essential for filling out the broader picture of
people in the Register, and linking them to other activities.
The informal **Lee Allen group** contributes to the Register by finding, indexing,
and matching records from sources outside the game to entries in the Register.
They look for records on baseball people in sources including:
* Obituaries and newspaper death notices (including those reported to
  the Baseball Necrology e-group);
* Birth and death indices, Social Security records,
  draft registration cards and military records, and other public records;
* Entries in findagrave.com;
* Entries on imdb.com;
* Records in databases from other sports.

## Progress and data quality

The group follows a systematic strategy of looking for information based on data
which are missing or ambiguous in baseball records.
In a typical week, the group identifies and confirms new records updating
the profiles of about 100 people.

Working systematically, and keeping track of which people have (and have not)
been researched, is essential, given that the population of professional baseball
players is likely around 250,000.
Experience shows that, even for names which are not that common, there are many
potential close matches in public records for a given player.
Further, with the preponderance of incomplete names and inaccurate dates of birth
in baseball records, matching records with a sufficient degree of confidence is
a labor-intensive process.

Therefore, while the group in principle welcomes leads for links to non-baseball
records of the kinds listed above which are candidate matches for baseball people,
they are not able to offer any guarantees of being able to respond to correspondence
on a particular record, or to offer any timelines on when new information on a particular
person may be updated in the Register.
